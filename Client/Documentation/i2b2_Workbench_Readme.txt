i2b2 Workbench Readme File
Version: 1.0
Build id: 20070606

The i2b2 Workbench is a collection of client-side components that communicate with i2b2 Cells 
and help aggregate their functionality in the Hive. Each component is designed as an Eclipse-based 
plug-in that interacts with a hive cell; collectively these plug-ins provide a cohesive entity to 
tie all the i2b2 cells together.  To start the application, please execute the file i2b2workbench.exe.  
A demonstration is usually available at the Harvard i2b2 site and can be run by selecting the 
"Start as demonstration only" check box and clicking the "login" button.  If you find any errors 
please report them to the i2b2 team.
