        <h1>Selecting Query Criteria</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>In order to create your query, you will choose patient demographics and diagnoses from the Navigate Terms tab on the left and place them in the Query Tool Group Panels to the right.  
			</li>
			<p></p> 
		</ul>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
			To choose Navigate Terms query items, click the '+' sign to the left of the item.  This expands the tree menu for you to see the choices available.  When you see the item you want to select, click on it and, while holding down the left mouse button, drag it to one of the Group Panels.  Continue until all criteria of the population you want to include are in one of the Group Panels.
			</li>
			<p></p>
		</ul>
			  
		<ul>
			<li>
			The way to build your query with the Group Panels is this:  If you add items to the same panel, you logically 'OR' the items (you broaden the population to include all patients who fit either one of those criteria).  If you put items in a different panel, you logically 'AND' the items (you limit the population by requiring that the patients must fulfill both requirements). 
			</li>
			<p></p> 
		</ul>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
			In our example, we want to find all female patients who have Asthma.  These two items are dragged to two different Group Panels to limit our patient population to those two criteria.
			</li>
		</ul>
