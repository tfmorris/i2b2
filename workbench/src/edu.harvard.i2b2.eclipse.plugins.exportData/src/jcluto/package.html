Provides a java interface to the <b>CLUTO</b> clustering toolkit library.

      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>CLUTO </b>is a software package for clustering
      low- and high-dimensional datasets and for analyzing the characteristics of the various clusters. 
      <b>CLUTO</b> is well-suited for
      clustering data sets arising in many diverse application areas including
      information retrieval, customer purchasing transactions, web, GIS, science, and
      biology.&nbsp;</p>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>CLUTO</b> provides three different classes of clustering 
      algorithms that operate either directly in the object's feature space or 
      in the object's similarity space. These algorithms are based on the <b><i>
      partitional</i></b>,&nbsp; <b><i>agglomerative</i></b>, and<b><i> 
      graph-partitioning </i></b>paradigms. A key feature in most of <b>CLUTO</b>'s 
      clustering algorithms is that they treat the clustering problem as an 
      optimization process which seeks to maximize or minimize a particular&nbsp;
      <i><b>clustering criterion function</b></i> defined either globally or 
      locally over the entire clustering solution space. <b>CLUTO</b> provides a total 
      of seven different criterion functions that can be used to drive both 
      partitional and agglomerative clustering algorithms, that are described&nbsp; 
      and analyzed in [<a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/publications/Papers/PDF/vscluster.pdf" target="main">ZK01</a>,
      <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/publications/Papers/PDF/vacluster.pdf" target="main">ZK02b</a>]. 
      Most of these criterion functions have been shown to produce high quality 
      clustering solutions in high dimensional datasets, especially those 
      arising in document clustering. In addition, <b>CLUTO</b> provides some of the 
      more traditional local criteria <i>(</i>e.g.<i>,</i> single-link, 
      complete-link, and UPGMA) that can be used in the context of agglomerative 
      clustering. Furthermore, <b>CLUTO</b> provides graph-partitioning-based 
      clustering algorithms that are well-suited for finding clusters that form 
      contiguous regions that span different dimensions of the underlying 
      feature space</p>


      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>JCluto</b></p>

      <p ALIGN="LEFT">The jcluto package is written to use java interfaces 
      as method parameters and return values so that alternate implementations 
      of specific classes are accommodated.
      </p>
      <p>
      Access to the <b>CLUTO</b> library functions is through methods in JClutoWrapper.java.
      The Java Native Interface code in JClutoWrapper.c maps the java methods to C functions.
      </p>
      <p>
      The graph-based cluto functions have not been tested yet, and the jcluto package
      does not yet offer parameter settings to call those functions.
      </p>
      <p>

      The <b>CLUTO</b> library was intended to be used in command line applications, and it will
      perform a system exit whenever it encounters parameters that it cannot handle.
      </p>
      <p>

      JCluto encpsulates the matrix format (rowptr, rowind, rowval in Section 5.2 of manual.pdf)
      in the ClutoMatrix interface.  The ClutoMatrix is implemented in the ClutoTableMatrix
      such that it also supports the javax.swing.table.TableModel interface, making it easy to
      display a cluto matrix in a javax.swing.JTable.
      </p>
      <p>

      The TransMatrixPanel provides a GUI interface to routines that can transform the
      ClutoMatrix.  These include missing value estimation to generate a dense matrix
      from a sparse one.  It can also perform a log transform on the matrix values.
      </p>
      <p>

      The ClutoOptionsPanel provides a GUI interface for setting the paramters for
      invoking a CLUTO clustering solution. This interface attempts to set parameters
      that are consistent with the chosen clustering method.
      </p>
      <p>

      The ClutoCluster class executes the CLUTO clustering method.  The method getParts()
      returns an int array that give the cluster/part  number the each row in the matrix
      was assigned to in the clustering solution.  The edu.umn.genomics.table.cluster.cluto
      package provides examples of displaying and visualizing the results of clustering.
